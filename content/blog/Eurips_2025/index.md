I am thrilled to share that my co-authors, my supervisor, and I attended the EurIPS conference and successfully presented a poster showcasing our research. 
We present a unified Bayesian decision-theoretic framework for conformal prediction (CP) that integrates Bayesian posterior predictive scores with risk minimization via Bayesian quadrature (BQ).

Our team was proud to be among the organisers of the EIML Workshop EurIPS (Copenhagen), contributing to an event that was both highly successful and enjoyable.

Also congrats to the successful organisation of the EIML workshop. I learned a lot and got so many interdisciplinary inspirations from experts around the world.

A big thank you to everyone involved for making this such a rewarding experience! Thanks again for my collaborator Veronika Lohmanova, and my supervisors Dr. Michele Caprio, Prof. Samuel Kaski 🚀
