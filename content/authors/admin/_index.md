Hello! Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

I am an AI PhD student in Decision Making in Complex Systems CDT led by University of Manchester and University of Cambridge, fully funded by [UK Research and Innovation](https://www.ukri.org/). I am supervised by [Dr Michele Caprio](https://michelecaprio.wixsite.com/caprio) and [Prof Samuel Kaski](https://kaski-lab.com/).

My current research interest is in AI for Science and uncertainty quantification. Specifically, I am studying Conformal Prediction (CP) and its relationship with other fields (such as Baysian infused CP, CP in medical diagonotics, CP in Astrophyics, etc). I enjoy very much on interdisplinary research and developing theoretical extensions on CP.

My previous backgrounds were in Bsc Physics department at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) and MPhil in Data Intensive Science at DAMTP, [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/). My bachelor thesis was about Single Photon Pairs Generation and Detection supervised [Dr Stefano Vezzoli](https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/s.vezzoli) in [Complex Nanophotonics Group](https://www.sapienzalab.org/). My master thesis was about Combinatorial Optimisation in Ising Machine Using Optical Parametric Oscillatior System, supervised by [Prof Natalia Berloff](https://www.pi-computing.org/team).

I am also open to industrial experiences and visiting interdisplinary reasearch groups.
